			    	a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
			    	specimen book. It has survived not only five
			    	centuries, but also the leap into electronic
			    	typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
			    	was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
			    	Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
			    	and more recently with desktop publishing software
			    	like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
			    	Ipsum.
