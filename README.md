# Microsoft DeepDive Computer Science Workshop

<b>This is a ten-week workshop series to introduce students to computer science foundations and the skills/techniques to keep in mind during a technical interview!</b>


Many students, especially those from historically low-income and underprivileged communities, are unaware of the technical and soft skills that are expected in tech sector jobs and the technical interview process. In this workshop we aim to help with these topics and cement the data structures and computer science concepts that come up during technical interviews through weekly workshop meetings. These meetings will be in the form of videos (live or recorded) that go over computer science topics such as arrays, linked lists, and recursion, and soft skills such as working the clock, proactive communication and developing a solution. There will also be assigned coding questions that cover the technical topic explored each week.

As a starter, the workshop has also been introduced to 3200+ Microsoft 2020 interns, with a special focus on the Explorer interns who can use the material to strengthen their foundations in Computer Science!


This website serves as a guide that showcases topics from each week of the workshop along with the videos and documents that supplement the meetings. This gives students the flexibility to learn at their own pace and contact us as and when they have any questions.
